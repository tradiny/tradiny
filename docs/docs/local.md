# Running Tradiny on Your Local Computer

Tradiny is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. The setup process is the same for all these platforms:

1. **Download Tradiny**

    - Go to the [Tradiny releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/tradiny/tradiny/releases) and download the application.

    - Unzip the downloaded archive.

1. **Configure Tradiny**

    - Run `setup.exe`.
    - Enter the necessary API keys.

    > **Note:** For Binance, a public cryptocurrency exchange, you don't need a real API key. Any random string will activate it.

1. **Run the Application**

    Launch `tradiny.exe` to start Tradiny. This will open a browser window where you can interact with the application.

You can now access Tradiny on your local network from any computer *or mobile phone* using any browser.
