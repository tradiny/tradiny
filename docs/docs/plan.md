# Vision

Tradiny is designed to make investing and trading simple and accessible for everyone.
Driven by the Founder's 2018 vision, Tradiny launched in 2020, offering technical analysis with over 160 integrated indicators and attracting over 100k active users on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

To further this vision of simplicity and accessibility, we released Tradiny in 2024 as open-source software for data analysts, investors, and traders explicitly allowing them to use the software for personal profit from investing and trading.

Now, everyone can install Tradiny on their computer, adjust it to their needs, and contribute to its development.

What's next? To continue supporting and developing Tradiny, we offer [commercial licenses](license.md). for businesses, along with customization options, white-label solutions, and the development of new features.
