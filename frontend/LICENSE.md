## 1. Dual-License Model

### 1.1 Open Source License (AGPL)
This Software is made available under the [GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), version 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), with the additional rights for individual users as detailed in [Section 2](#2-for-individuals).

### 1.2 Commercial License
In addition to the AGPL, commercial licenses are available for those who wish to use the Software in proprietary, closed-source products or services. Please see [Section 4](#4-for-businesses) for details on obtaining a commercial license.

---

## 2. For Individuals

### 2.1 Permitted Use
Individual users, including traders and investors, may use this Software to analyze data, make investment decisions, and generate personal profit without any obligation to disclose their own proprietary trading strategies or tools derived from the Software. These rights apply provided that:
- You do not redistribute the Software, in whole or in part.  
- You do not use the Software to create publicly available tools or services.

---

## 3. General AGPL Conditions

### 3.1 Distribution of Modified Versions
Under the AGPL, if you modify the Software and **distribute** or otherwise provide those modifications to others—whether by sharing compiled code, making the Software available for download, or hosting it as a service—you must also make the source code of your modified version available under the same AGPL terms.

### 3.2 Attribution
All AGPL users must provide proper attribution to the original authors, as required by the AGPL.

---

## 4. For Businesses

Businesses, organizations, and individuals seeking to use the Software in a commercial or organizational context have **two options**:

### 4.1 Use Under AGPL
If you choose to use the Software under the AGPL license, you must:
- Release any modifications you make to the Software.  
- Provide attribution to the original authors.  

### 4.2 Commercial Licensing (No Restrictions)
If you wish to avoid the AGPL’s requirements (e.g., releasing modifications) or desire additional flexibility for white-labeling, custom development, and new feature creation, you must obtain a commercial license by contacting  
[license@tradiny.com](mailto:license@tradiny.com). This option imposes no such restrictions and allows for customization, white-label solutions, and other proprietary use cases.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. I am a trader or investor. How can I use the Software?
- You are free to use the Software under the AGPL to analyze data, make investment decisions, and generate personal profit.  
- You have no obligation to release any proprietary strategies or tools that you develop on top of the Software.  
- These rights remain valid as long as you do not redistribute the Software or use it to create publicly available tools or services.

### 2. I am a business and I want to use the Software in a Docker container.

**Option 1: AGPL Compliance**  
- If you choose to use the Software under the AGPL, you must provide attribution to the original authors.  
- You must release any modifications to the Software under the AGPL, including any changes that affect how the Software runs inside the container.

**Option 2: Commercial License**  
- If you prefer not to release modifications or provide attribution, you may purchase a commercial license.  
- Contact [license@tradiny.com](mailto:license@tradiny.com) for more information.

> **Note:** Simply packaging the unmodified Software into a Docker container does not, by itself, trigger additional obligations under the AGPL, but any modifications you make to the Software or its dependencies that create a derivative work will require compliance with the AGPL’s terms.

### 3. I am a business and I want to integrate the Software into my app (e.g., embedding, linking, tight coupling, or using it as a dependency).

- **Unmodified Integration (e.g., Iframe or Separate Hosting):**  
  If you embed or reference an **unmodified** instance of the Software (for instance, via an iframe or as a distinct service), you do **not** need to release your entire application under the AGPL. However, you still must comply with attribution requirements as specified by the Software’s license.

- **Modified or Tightly Coupled Integration:**  
  If you **modify** the Software or tightly couple it with your code—such that the combined work is effectively one program—you must:  
  1. Release your entire application under the AGPL or a compatible license, and  
  2. Provide attribution to the original authors.

If you wish to avoid releasing your application under the AGPL, **contact [license@tradiny.com](mailto:license@tradiny.com) to obtain a commercial license.**
